# placeholder_csv_IT_assets
A repository with a bunch of placeholder IT assets stored in CSV files, generated using Chat GPT. 

I chose Chat GPT, because I needed a bunch of placeholder assets to inject into GLPI ITSM software, just to make sure the plugin I installed was working properly, and I could find no such data online nor did I have time to create such files myself.
The results of the prompts can be found in this folder, in separate CSV files.

The results are far from perfect - for instance, Chat mixed up manufacturers and their models: it created a **Google Pixel monitor, which was supposably manufactured by Asus**.
I didn't bother to fine tune my prompts to make it correct it's mistakes since it was enough for me to set up GLPI, but I might do it in the future.
